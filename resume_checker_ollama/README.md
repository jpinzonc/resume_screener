# Flask Template

This sample repo contains the recommended structure for a Python Flask project for a resume scanner

The idea is to find keywords matches between the job description and the resume. 

There are two ways the code works, 

1. keyword search via spacy 
2. keyword search via Ollama - Using Ollama3.2

Both codes were created by using CoPilot with Chat GPT4.1. 

to run the codes just navegate to the root folder for each application and type: 

- flask run
